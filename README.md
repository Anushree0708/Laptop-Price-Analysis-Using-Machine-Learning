This project implements a machine learning–based laptop price prediction system developed in Python using an optimized regression pipeline. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation on a feature-rich dataset containing 23 hardware attributes, enabling robust learning of complex price patterns.
Multiple regression and ensemble learning models were evaluated, with the XGBoost Regressor achieving the best performance, delivering an R² score of 0.885. The results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in accurately estimating laptop prices based on hardware specifications, supporting data-driven pricing strategies and market analysis.
